This is a WebAssembly (wasm) implementation
with the primary features being:

- Interpreter?
- Converts to C++?
- JIT?
- Understandable by me hopefully.
- Written in C++? C? C++11? C++98?
- Why not write in C?
 - C is a horrible language.
- Why not generate C?
 - Maybe for exception handling. We'll see.
 - C is a horrible language.
